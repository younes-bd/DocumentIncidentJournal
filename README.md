| Description  | Documenting a cybersecurity incident  | 
| Tool(s) used | None. |
| The 5 W's  | ●	Who: An organized group of unethical hackers ●	What: A ransomware security incident ●	Where: At a health care company ●	When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. ●	Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.|
| Additional notes | 1.	How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? </br> 2.	Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key |
