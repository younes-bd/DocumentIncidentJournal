| Description  | Documenting a cybersecurity incident  | 
| Tool(s) used | None. |
| The 5 W's  | ●	Who: An organized group of unethical hackers </br> ●	What: A ransomware security incident </br> ●	Where: At a health care company </br>●	When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. </br> ●	Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. </br> The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.</br> |
| Additional notes | 1.	How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? </br> 2.	Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key |
| Incident Handler's Assessment: | ● Assessment: This incident poses a severe risk to the health care company's data and operations, as the attackers have successfully encrypted critical files.</br> ● Immediate Actions Taken:- Isolated the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.- Notified the IT team to assess the extent of the encryption and identify affected files.</br> ● Communication: Senior management and legal department have been informed about the incident.</br> ● Response Plan: Initiated the incident response plan, including coordination with external cybersecurity experts to assess recovery options and forensic analysis. |
| Incident Resolution (Ongoing): |● Recovery: Work is underway to decrypt the affected files and restore normal operations. </br> ● Forensic Analysis: Engaged a cybersecurity forensics team to investigate the source of the phishing attack and identify the attackers.</br> ● Preventative Measures: Planning to implement stronger email security measures and conducting cybersecurity training for employees to prevent future phishing attacks. |
| Post-Incident Review (Planned): | ● Lessons Learned: A post-incident review will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's cybersecurity practices.</br> ● Paying the Ransom: The company is carefully considering the legal, ethical, and financial implications of paying the ransom and will make an informed decision. |
