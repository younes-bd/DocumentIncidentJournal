| Who: An organized group of unethical hackers                               |
| ●                                                                          |
| What: A ransomware security incident                                       |
| ●                                                                          |
| Where: At a health care company                                            |
| ●                                                                          |
| When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m.                                                    |
| ●                                                                          |
| Why: The incident happened because unethical                               |
| hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. |
| After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the       |
| company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation    |
| appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large |
| sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.                           |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| Additional notes                                                           |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| How could the health care company                                          |
| prevent an incident like this from occurring again?                        |
| Should the company pay the ransom to                                       |
| retrieve the decryption key?                                               |
