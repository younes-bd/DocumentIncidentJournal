| Description  | Documenting a cybersecurity incident  | 
| Tool(s) used | None. |
| The 5 W's  | ●	Who: An organized group of unethical hackers </br> ●	What: A ransomware security incident </br> ●	Where: At a health care company </br>●	When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. </br> ●	Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. </br> The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.</br> |
| Additional notes | 1.	How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? </br> 2.	Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key |
| Incident Handler's Assessment: | ● Assessment: This incident poses a severe risk to the health care company's data and operations, as the attackers have successfully encrypted critical files.</br> ● Immediate Actions Taken:- Isolated the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.- Notified the IT team to assess the extent of the encryption and identify affected files.</br> ● Communication: Senior management and legal department have been informed about the incident.</br> ● Response Plan: Initiated the incident response plan, including coordination with external cybersecurity experts to assess recovery options and forensic analysis. |
| Incident Resolution (Ongoing): |● Recovery: Work is underway to decrypt the affected files and restore normal operations. </br> ● Forensic Analysis: Engaged a cybersecurity forensics team to investigate the source of the phishing attack and identify the attackers.</br> ● Preventative Measures: Planning to implement stronger email security measures and conducting cybersecurity training for employees to prevent future phishing attacks. |
| Post-Incident Review (Planned): | ● Lessons Learned: A post-incident review will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's cybersecurity practices.</br> ● Paying the Ransom: The company is carefully considering the legal, ethical, and financial implications of paying the ransom and will make an informed decision. |

| Description  | Documenting a cybersecurity incident involving an unauthorized data breach.| 
| Tool(s) used | None. |
| The 5 W's  | ● Who: Unknown threat actors.</br> ●  What: Unauthorized data breach.</br> ● Where: At XYZ Corporation, a financial services company.</br> ● When: Monday, July 22, 2024, at 3:30 PM. </br> ● Why: The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in an unpatched server, allowing attackers to access sensitive customer data. The motive appears to be data theft for potential financial gain. |
| Additional notes | 1.	How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? </br> 2.	Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key |
| Incident Handler's Assessment: | ● Immediate Actions Taken: Upon detection, the incident response team (IRT) was immediately notified. The affected server was isolated from the network to prevent further unauthorized access. IT personnel initiated an initial assessment to understand the extent of the breach.</br> ● Communication: Senior management and the legal department were informed of the incident. An external cybersecurity forensics team was engaged to conduct an initial analysis.</br> ● Response Plan: The incident response plan was activated, focusing on identifying the source of the breach and containing it. The external forensics team began collecting evidence. |
| Incident Resolution (Ongoing): | ● Efforts are underway to assess the compromised data, including customer information and financial records.</br> ● The forensic analysis aims to identify the attack vector and determine the attackers' origin.</br> ● Preventative measures, including server patching and strengthening network security, have been initiated.</br> ● Communication with affected customers and regulatory authorities will be prioritized once the full extent of the breach is determined. |
| Post-Incident Review (Planned): | ● A post-incident review will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's cybersecurity practices.</br> ● Recommendations for improving incident response procedures and patch management will be developed.</br> ● Legal and ethical considerations regarding data breach disclosure will be discussed during the review. |
